## Overview

gwasrapidd is a REST API R client for the [GWAS
Catalog](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas), allowing you to download:

- Studies with `get_studies()`
- Associations with `get_associations()`
- Variants with `get_variants()`
- Traits with `get_traits()`

Each function returns an S4 object that encapsulates a set of tables (dataframes), that together, form a relational database for each object type.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ramiromagno/gwasrapidd")
```

## Getting started

The GWAS Catalog is a service provided by the EMBL-EBI and NHGRI that offers a
manually curated and freely available database of published genome-wide
association studies (GWAS). The Catalog website and infrastructure is hosted by
the [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk).

There are three ways to access the Catalog database:

- via the Web interface at
[https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas)
- by downloading a
database dump in TSV or RDF/OWL formats:
[https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/file-downloads](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/file-downloads)
- or through the GWAS Catalog REST API:
[https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/rest/docs/api](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/rest/docs/api)

gwasrapidd facilitates the access to the Catalog via the Catalog REST API,
allowing you to programmatically retrieve data directly into R.



## Usage

The Catalog REST API provides four types of data objects for retrieval:

- Studies
- Associations
- Variants
- Traits

gwasrapidd provides four corresponding functions to get each of the object
types: `get_studies()`, `get_associations()`, `get_variants()` and
`get_traits()`.
